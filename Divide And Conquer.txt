Divide and conquer is the algorithm of dividing and the data into smaller parts and
solving the smaller data and then merging the smaller parts to get the final result.


It makes the problem solving easy and reduces the time complexity of algorithm.


Few examples of divide and conquer are Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search and many other 
algorithms.
